### Impact Miner - Scaling Impact of Last Mile Funding 
We are building Impact Miner ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.company.atlantis&hl=en_IN&pli=1), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/impact-miner/id6448894610)), an onchain bounties platform that bridges the gap between climate impact funders, sustainability organizations, and green gig workers. Our platform focuses on verifiable impact reporting, affordable certification, and efficient last-mile fund delivery. We ensure every contribution is transparently tracked and effectively utilized by seamlessly connecting large-scale corporate capital with local climate action projects. Impact certificates minted on Impact Miner are NFTs that are backed by real world validated actions.

Who will benefit?
1. Impact Funds: They can efficiently deploy their capital toward verifiable, impactful projects, benefiting from transparent, real-time data that helps optimize their sustainability strategies.
2. Sustainability Organizations and Green Gig Workers: These groups gain easier access to funding while reducing the costs and barriers traditionally associated with securing financial support.
3. Local Communities: Communities involved in climate action projects will see more funding reach the ground level where it is most needed, fostering scalable and impactful climate actions.
