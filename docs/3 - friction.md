### Friction - Crafting Measurable High Impact Bounties
We discovered that the creation of bounties for funders is a time-consuming process. Articulating a clear scope and defining success metrics are critical for the successful completion of bounties, but this requires significant effort. Additionally, the manual input of details to set up a bounty became a significant friction point, particularly for newly onboarded communities.

In workshops conducted in partnership with local funders, we have compiled the following list of critical questions to guide the design of effective bounties.
- **Is the bounty well-defined?**  
    Are the objectives and outcomes clearly articulated, avoiding ambiguity? For example, does a water-access project specify whether it involves infrastructure, management, or policy changes? Clear definitions prevent misaligned efforts and wasted resources.
- **Is the scope appropriately balanced?**  
    Does the bounty strike the right balance between being broad enough to address the core issue and specific enough to ensure actionable steps? For instance, does it avoid being too generic (“reduce plastic waste”) or overly narrow (“collect 100 bottles on one beach”)?
- **Are the success metrics measurable?**  
    How will success be quantified and verified? Do the metrics align with broader goals and capture tangible impact? For example, is success in “improving forest cover” measured by trees planted, survival rates, or biodiversity outcomes?
- **Is the goal achievable within local constraints?**  
    Are the objectives realistic given the local context, resources, and timelines? For example, can the community realistically transition to solar-powered irrigation, or are there economic and cultural barriers that need addressing first?
- **Does the bounty reflect local community needs?**  
    Is the bounty aligned with the priorities, cultural contexts, and stakeholder needs of the local community? For instance, is the solution meaningful and practical for the community, ensuring buy-in and long-term adoption?
- **Can the aspiration be broken into milestones?**  
    Are there smaller, actionable steps that contribute toward long-term goals? For example, can a “net-zero carbon emissions” target be broken into milestones like retrofitting 20% of buildings with solar panels in the first phase?
- **Is the bounty adaptive to uncertainties?**  
    Does the design account for unexpected variables such as weather, supply chain delays, or policy changes? For instance, are there contingency plans or flexible timelines to adapt to real-world challenges?
- **Do incentives encourage meaningful participation?**  
    Are the incentives structured to motivate action without unintended consequences? For example, does rewarding tree planting include ensuring their survival, avoiding quantity-focused rewards that neglect quality?
- **Are all stakeholders included in the process?**  
    Has input been sought from funders, implementers, and local communities to design the bounty collaboratively? For example, are there mechanisms to balance funder goals with local feasibility and practical constraints?
- **Does the bounty ensure transparency and accountability?**  
    Are the goals, process, and outcomes clearly documented and communicated? For example, are guidelines and reporting mechanisms in place to ensure that stakeholders trust the process and results?
