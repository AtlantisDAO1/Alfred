### How can you contribute?
Atlantis decided to make **Alfred** an open source solution to address a shared global challenge: the coordination and delivery of last-mile funding for climate impact. Having thrived through funding and grants within the Web3 public goods ecosystem, Atlantis recognizes the transformative potential of open collaboration and decentralized innovation. Open-sourcing Alfred is our way of paying it forward, enabling other climate solution pioneers to contribute, adapt, and leverage the tool for their unique challenges.

By making Alfred accessible, we aim to foster a global community dedicated to improving the design and deployment of impactful bounties. This ensures that the principles and insights driving Alfred's development—such as transparency, scalability, and inclusivity—are not confined to a single organization but become a shared resource in the fight against climate change. Together, through collective contributions, we can amplify Alfred’s potential and scale its impact across diverse climate action frontiers.

We’re excited to have you join us in shaping Alfred into a powerful tool for climate and sustainability solutions. As we test our MVP (v0), your feedback and contributions are critical to its evolution. Whether you’re a developer, designer, researcher, or just someone passionate about climate action, there’s a way for you to contribute.
