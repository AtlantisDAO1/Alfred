### Motivation - Using Global Rails for Local Challenges in Climate and Sustainability
Living in India, every member of the Atlantis team has experienced the devastating effects of climate shocks firsthand. These events can uproot lives overnight, disrupting essential systems like water, energy, shelter, food, and access to goods. Addressing climate change is a clear priority, yet achieving consensus and effective action remains a significant challenge.

From our vantage point on the frontlines, we understand that current incentives for tackling climate issues are poorly designed, creating substantial bottlenecks for impact financing. This insight, gained over six years in the industry, has given us deep, hands-on experience with the hurdles and possibilities in this space. We believe that accelerating climate action isn't a technological challenge—it's a coordination problem. By improving coordination mechanisms, we can tackle this issue effectively at institutional, community, and individual levels.

Our [pilot in rural India](https://medium.com/mercy-corps-social-venture-fund/pilot-insights-improving-clean-water-access-via-decentralized-web3-networks-c9f3931f2050), funded by a grant from Mercy Corps Ventures, revealed a strong demand for decentralized solutions, showing improved access to clean water, better affordability, and enhanced financial resilience for participants. This experience has underscored a broader market need for solutions that provide transparent and efficient financial connections between funders and those executing climate-positive actions on the ground.

In our engagement with multiple impact funds we have witnessed a critical gap in tooling to ensure that resources are effectively used where they are most needed. In addition, we have captured a clear demand for tools that not only facilitate meaningful climate action but also enable businesses to make data-driven decisions that maximize their environmental contributions and build trust with their stakeholders.

The current climate action landscape faces several key challenges:
1. Coordination Gaps: There's a disconnect between large-scale corporate capital and local climate action projects, particularly in emerging economies, leading to inefficient fund allocation and unmet climate goals.
2. Lack of Transparency and Trust: Opacity in carbon markets raises concerns about the credibility and effectiveness of funded projects.
3. Verification Bottlenecks: Manual monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) processes are time-consuming, costly, and often inaccurate, making it challenging to ensure tangible results.

Blockchain emerges as a powerful coordination substrate in this context. It can codify incentive designs that encourage actions toward socially beneficial outcomes at scale. By enabling decentralized, transparent, and trustless systems, blockchain aligns the interests of diverse stakeholders and drives collective action to overcome common coordination failures. 

As Nobel laureate **Elinor Ostrom** famously observed:

> **"There is no reason to believe that bureaucrats and politicians, no matter how well meaning, are better at solving problems than the people on the spot, who have the strongest incentive to get the solution right."**

This philosophy underpins our approach, as we aim to empower local actors with the tools and incentives to take ownership of climate solutions, ensuring more effective and scalable outcomes. Blockchain provides the infrastructure to achieve this vision, connecting global resources to address local challenges with precision and accountability.
