I want to design a bounty for raising awareness on sustainable mobility in Bangalore

ASSISTANT:
Designing a bounty to raise awareness on sustainable mobility in Bangalore is a great initiative! Let's start by breaking down the process into actionable steps. We'll begin with defining the objectives of your bounty.

### Step 1: Define Objectives

- **What kind of awareness are you aiming for?** (e.g., educational content, community events, digital campaigns)

**Example Objective:** Increase awareness and adoption of cycling as a sustainable mode of transport among university students in Bangalore.

Once you've defined your objectives, we can move to the next step of designing the bounty. Would you like to refine the objective further, or shall we proceed to the next step?

### Step 2: Define the Scope and Criteria

- Create and share educational content (e.g., infographics, videos) on social media, reaching at least 500 students.

### Step 3: Determine the Rewards

Decide on the type and amount of reward that will motivate participants. Rewards can be monetary, in-kind, or recognition-based.
