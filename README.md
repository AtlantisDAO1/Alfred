### Motivation - Using global rails for local challenges in climate and sustainability
The Atlantis team has witnessed firsthand the devastating impacts of climate shocks in India, disrupting vital systems like water, energy, and food. The core challenge in addressing climate change isn’t technology—it’s coordination. Our [pilot in rural India](https://medium.com/mercy-corps-social-venture-fund/pilot-insights-improving-clean-water-access-via-decentralized-web3-networks-c9f3931f2050) showed the potential of decentralized solutions to enhance resilience, affordability, and transparency. However, gaps in coordination, trust, and verification persist. Blockchain provides a transparent, scalable framework to align global resources with local climate action, empowering communities to take ownership and drive meaningful impact.

### Impact Miner - Scaling impact of last mile funding
Impact Miner by Atlantis is an on-chain bounties platform ([Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.company.atlantis&hl=en_IN&pli=1), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/impact-miner/id6448894610)), that connects climate impact funders, sustainability organizations, and green gig workers. It ensures transparent, verifiable impact reporting, affordable certification, and efficient fund delivery. Contributions are tracked through NFTs backed by real-world validated actions.

Who benefits?
- Impact Funds: Deploy capital efficiently with real-time, transparent data.
- Sustainability Organizations & Workers: Gain easy access to funding with reduced costs.
- Local Communities: Receive more direct funding for scalable, impactful climate actions.

### Friction - Crafting measurable high impact bounties
Creating effective bounties is time-consuming, requiring clear scopes, measurable success metrics, and significant manual effort—especially for newly onboarded communities. Through workshops with funders, we identified key questions to streamline bounty design:
- Is the goal well-defined, realistic, and aligned with local needs?
- Are success metrics measurable and actionable?
- Can the goal be broken into milestones?
- Does the design account for uncertainties and ensure transparency?
- Are all stakeholders included in the process, and do incentives encourage meaningful participation?
- Addressing these challenges is critical to making bounties impactful, scalable, and adaptive to real-world constraints.
